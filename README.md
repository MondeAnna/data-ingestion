<h5 align="center">Introduction</H3>


<a href=https://www.asisa.org.za/about-us/">ASISA</a> is a non-profit organisation that represents South Africa's financial services sector. In essence, offering a union, wherein membership gives companies in the savings, investment and insurance industries a combined voice in discussions and negotiations with regulators, policymakers and other stakeholders, such as intermediaries, the media and consumers.

To our great benefit, ASISA also provides <a href="https://www.asisa.org.za/statistics/">statistics</a> relating to the financial services sector and it is with those that we will concern ourselves.

The task ahead of us is preparing Analysis and CISFunds sheets data, published in Flows documentation, for ingestion and to do so for any available quarter. To our great joy, the source data is already in a flat state and merely misses quarterly dates. Concerning CISFunds, there are years without data, a point to remain cognizant of.
